         websites. I've accumilated my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, bringing designs to life with a keen eye for detail.

         and growing in this dynamic field as one should. I love taking on new challenges and am always eager to collaborate on projects that 
         push my boundaries so I can increase my skill level. I like to fill my down time expericancing new things while traverlling to places I 
         haven't been before. Look forward to hearing from you soon and hopfully we can build some great projects together
